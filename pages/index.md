# Hey, I'm Guillaume

I'm a software engineer involved in the open-source OCaml ecosystem at [Tarides](http://www.tarides.com).

I will document my personal projects in this tiny space of the web.
You can also take a look at my work on [Github](https://github.com/gpetiot/), or reach out to me by email at: <i>hello</i> at <i>guillaumepetiot.com</i>.

In a previous life I authored and co-authored [research papers](./research.html) about software verification.
